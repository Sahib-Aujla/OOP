Workshop part 1 wasn't that tough only the tester file mismatch was a problem which was solved by our professor.
However, workshop part 2 was difficult as compared to all the workshops starting from workshop2 (workshop 1 was hard as well),.
This workshop gave me a lot of problems as there were a lot of functions to be made and overloaded, 
there were a lot of errors like the ambiguous function or the function definition should be different and stuff like that,
I spent a lot of time understanding the difference, some needed to be constant which can't alter the object and can
only return a value like int(),bool(),double() somehow I had to figure that out, then with the other functions as well
they weren't working like the overloaded +=,-= and + operators. The issue got resolved by using a single keyword,
const with the parameters, I spent like 2-3 hours trying different things an it got solved by using const.

I really don't know why but my speculation is compiler differentiates between overloaded operators through the different parameters like if they are constant
and other values.
Another error at the time of submission of the last line with the + operator, I didn't need to return a mark object
as with Mark object [] were printed due to the overloaded the cout function, so I changed its return type.
Overall, I went back and forth in this workshop, a lot of changes were made.
Cannot differnetiate by return type alone is an error I got a lot, however somehow i was able to overcome it
and eventually complete this workshop thanks to God.
