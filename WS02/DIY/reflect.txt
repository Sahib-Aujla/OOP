In this workshop I learned about dynamic memory, how to create dynamic memory, how to store values
in it and how to delete it using the delete keyword which deletes the value stored in the heap.
In this workshop the main problem that I had was in storing the value dynamically in the double pointer.
I had to revisit the difference between * and without star with the pointer, because I was confusing it
with the char array and strings because they are initially they store the address of the variables stored in them
So i had a problem with that concept only, (I might not have been able to clarify this well in the reflection)
other than that the workshop led me to have a stronger grasp on these concepts which were explained 
by our professor. Other than that , there were small errors which were due to my small mistakes,
however I was able to overcome them thanks to god.

The biggest problem that I faced and I struggled for 2 days to solve that problem. And at last I was 
able to solve that error thanks to my professor, who helped me to point out my mistake and helped me to fix my issue.
The memory leak error that I was getting because I didn't close my file. which caused a memory leak
of 568 bytes and I wasn't able to figure out why, However when i sent my files to my professor, she pointed
out my mistake and thanks to her I solved it.
