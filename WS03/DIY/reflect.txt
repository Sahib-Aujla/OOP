In the workshop 3 I applied what I learned a week before by our professor. Through this workshop I 
learned about input and ouput formatting with various new functions with cin and cout. It was a 
bit difficult to grasp it on the first try, eventually when you try it for yourself you get a 
better understanding. I had a lot of error with cout.fill() and cout.width() statements. I got confused that
why it wasn't working well. for the other couts in the prnumber() function. Then I remembered a thing
our professor said in the class, it was that cout.setf would be applied for all, however width and
fill would only be applicable for one cout and needs to be reset afterwards.
This saved me and I was able to identify and solve this problem.
In workshop 2 part 2 the tricky thing was to understand the links between different classes. How to
access the other class members for printing and calculating the length, however once that was figured
out I was able to do this workshop thanks to god.
