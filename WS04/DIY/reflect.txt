In  this workshop we practised constructors and destructors and how to work with operator references.
The biggest trouble that I got was due to getline in ws4 part 1. The reason was I was implementing it wrong,
because i forgot how to use the delimmiter and I was putting the second argument as the delimmiter.
I was doing cinRef.getline(name,','); which was wrong because the 2nd argument should be the max number of chars.
I rectfied my mistake by doing some rresearch on getline and then I was able to implement it correctly.
The next one was at display function because my input buffer had a '\n' and a new line was printing which was sought
by using cinRef.ignore();

The second part of the workshop pushed me to think the structure and implementation of a whole class
which included constructors detructors and many more other functions. I tried my best to implement DRY concept.
I was able to complete this workshop without much trouble thanks to god.
